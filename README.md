This project aims to analyze and visualize the key insights and sales parameters for one of the top retail companies in the world. Dummy data has been used here to abide by the non-disclosure agreement with the client. Power BI has been used to process the data, create a database for easy management, explore the data visually, and gain valuable insights.
